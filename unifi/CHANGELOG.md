## ⚠️ Deprecation warning

This is the final release that supports 32-bits operating systems. Support for 32-bits architectures (armhf, armv7 & i386) will be dropped as of the next release.

The way this add-on currently works around limitations for making it work on those architectures isn't sustainable for the future and slowly becomes problematic. If you are using one of the deprecated architectures, you can update to this release and use that for as long as you want, however, you won't be offered an upgrade to the next release.

If you run a 32-bits operating system, we highly recommend moving/upgrading to a 64-bits OS.
